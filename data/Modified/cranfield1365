  1365   approximate calculation of the laminar boundary layer     thwaites b    aero  quart  1  1949 1950      after analyzing a large class of boundary layer velocityprofiles  the author discovered that the functions l(m) and h(m) for all such cases differ only slightly from each other over the whole range of positive and negative pressure gradients    here l  m and h are defined by being the velocitycomponent in the x direction and u the value of u at the edge of the boundary layer and and the displacement and momentum thickness  respectively    based on this discovery  an approximate method is proposed by constructing two universal curves l(m) and h(m) for all conceivable boundary layer flows found in practice    once these are chosen  karman momentum integral can be written in the form  v being the kinematic viscosity coefficient  and can be integrated numerically    as examples  both howarth and hartree tained is considered good for practical purposes
